Review : Had amazing time, the staff is awesome. Everyone is super friendly, welcoming and very dedicated. The whole property is beautiful and very well taken care of. If you’re looking for somewhere quiet but not too far away from town this is the spot. Plus Maple, one of the kittens at the property is adorable

Review : I stayed at Rumah Daisy Cantik for two nights and had an amazing time. The room and grounds are beautiful and so well maintained. The staff were incredibly kind and helpful. I also loved the big pool with the Buddha statue, happy rescue animals on the grounds, and delicious breakfast. Honestly, this is the closest experience I've had to the kind of beautiful serenity that I remember when I first visited Bali in 2006. I didn't want to leave and hope to visit again sometime soon.
